            "At the heart of a soundscape is the organization and design of sound to create an auditory environment that triggers an emotional response and deeper associations in the listener.
            <br><br>
            Soundscape is a way of perceiving our environment in addition to sight and touch. It is a way of perceiving sounds and the sights presented by sounds in the environment through the sense of hearing. Soundscapes are ubiquitous in our daily lives, affecting our emotions and feelings without even realizing it. Let's delve into the definition and characteristics of soundscape and how it affects us."
        </p>
        "Cities and Memory" is a large-scale global sound project founded in 2014 by British sound artist Stuart Fowkes, documenting the sounds of cities recorded around the world by over 1,800 artists. Almost every marker on the map has two versions of the sound: the city version and the memory version.

    Gabriel Martin created a web app called "A Soft Murmur" in 2014. It allows you to create your own calming environment by combining relaxing sounds such as rain, ocean waves, and birdsong. It's ideal for focusing, relaxing, or just enjoying peaceful sounds.
    </p>
    "Soundscape World" was created by interactive media creator and sound designer Max Million, and in 2020, the project was launched as a platform that allows users to combine visual and auditory components to create dynamic, immersive soundscapes.
