    <h1>Three Silly Limericks</h1>    
    <div>
        <p><span class="title">Keith</span><br>
        An elderly man called Keith,<br>
        Mislaid his set of false teeth.<br>
        They'd been laid on a chair,<br>
        He'd forgot they were there,<br>
        Sat down, and was bitten beneath.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><span class="title">Miss Dowd</span><br>
        A mouse in her room woke Miss Dowd,<br>
        She was frightenedâ€”it must be allowed.<br>
        Soon a happy thought hit her<br>
        To scare off the critter,<br>
        She sat up in bed and meowed.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><span class="title">Dwight</span><br>
        There once was a runner named Dwight,<br>
        Who could speed even faster than light.<br>
        He set out one day,<br>
        In a relative way,<br>
        And returned on the previous night.</p>

    <h2 id="theend">The End</h2>
