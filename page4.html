    <h1>Inside the Bus</h1>
    <p>You decide to observe the inside of the bus to prepare for whatever may come. Quietly, you take in the surroundings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There's a faint smell of rot and blood in the air, but you can't pinpoint its source.</li>
        <li>The bus lighting is a warm yellow, oddly calming.</li>
        <li>The roof hatch is open.</li>
        <li>There aren't many passengers, and no one is standing.</li>
        <li>At every stop, someone gets off and disappears without a trace.</li>
        <li>Your seat is the closest to the door, making it the easiest for you to get off.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>What will you do next?</p>
    <ul>

        <li><a href="page7.html">Wait until closer to home</a></li>
